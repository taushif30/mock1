    <h1>QUESTION ANSWERS</h1>
    <br />
    <h4>Q1: Difference between div and span?</h4>
    <p>
      Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related
      parts of a web page. However, they serve different functions. A div
      element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements,
      whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling.
    </p>

    <h4>Q2: Difference between class and IDs ?</h4>
    <p>
      A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must
      only be used by one HTML element within the page.
    </p>

    <h4>Q3:What are self closing tags ?</h4>
    <p>
      A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be
      closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a
      separate closing tag as tag. Some few self-closing tags are input, hr, br,
      img, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Q4: How many types of headings are there ?How to decide which to use
      where?
    </h4>
    <p>
      HTML defines six levels of headings, and these heading elements are H1,
      H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6. The H1 element is the highest or most important
      level, and the H6 element is the least important. These different heading
      levels help to communicate the organization and hierarchy of the content
      on a page. examples are below
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><h1>First</h1></li>
      <li><h2>First</h2></li>
      <li><h3>First</h3></li>
      <li><h4>First</h4></li>
      <li><h5>First</h5></li>
      <li><h6>First</h6></li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Q5:Difference between block and inline?</h4>
    <p>
      Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start
      from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as
      it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in
      the HTML element.
    </p>

    <h4>Q6:Difference between em and strong</h4>
    <p>
      The em tag element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the i
      tag element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such as
      a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to
      the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning.
    </p>

    <h4>Q7: What are attributes?</h4>
    <p>
      All HTML elements can have attributes · Attributes provide additional
      information about elements · Attributes are always specified in the start
      tag
    </p>

    <h4>Q8: Diffrence between HTML tags and element ?</h4>
    <p>
      HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page. HTML Elements are components
      that are used in HTML Page. HTML Tags usually exist in pairs consisting of
      a starting and an ending tag. However, some tags do not have a closing tag
